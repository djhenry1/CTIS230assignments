<h1><img src="Images/riseofai.jpeg"><br>The Rise of AI</h1>
<p>AI has become increasingly intelligent over the last year or two. In the case of DDoS attacks AIs have been trained to execute hacks faster and more efficiently. These algorithms will constantly learn from their mistakes in which they can find new and unexpected weak points. AI is also becoming a very cheap resource to use, in some cases there are free resources such as ChatGPT. ChatGPT has already been used to sophisticate pretext for phishing or to generate malicious code in just a few simple questions without even having advanced knowledge. AI has made its way into virtually every industry. A lot of companies are putting the technology into different business functions such as logistics and IT. There are news reports saying Â¾ of global businesses are considering, if not already implementing a ban on using ChatGPT or other AI applications inside the workplace.Data security and privacy concerns are the main security concerns driving towards a ban on ChatGPT and other AI apps.<a href="Webdesignnotes.html">Publications</a></p>

<h2>Key Factors</h2>
<p>Several key factors that you should take into consideration when implementing AI to facilitate your business processes include:<br>Data Quality: Make sure to have a clean and well-annotated dataset to train your model.<br>Hardware: Consider the computational requirements of your AI solution and ensure that you have the necessary hardware resources to support it.<br>Security and Privacy: Make sure to consider the security and privacy of the data used to train and deploy the model and the security of the system itself.<br>Maintenance: AI systems require regular maintenance and updates, so consider how you will keep your system updated and running smoothly over time.<br>Monitoring: Consider how you will monitor the performance of your AI solution and how you will troubleshoot and fix issues if they arise.</p>
<h2>More AI facts</h2>
<p>Artificial general intelligence (AGI), also known as strong AI, is still a hypothetical concept as it involves a machine understanding and performing vastly different tasks based on its accumulated experience. This type of intelligence is more on the level of human intellect, as AGI systems would be able to reason and think like a human. And Like a human, AGI would potentially be able to understand any intellectual task, think abstractly, learn from its experiences, and use that knowledge to solve new problems. Essentially, we're talking about a system or machine capable of common sense, which is currently not achievable with any form of available AI.</p>
