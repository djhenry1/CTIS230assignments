<p>Wi-Fi 6 which is also known as 802.11ax, is the latest generation and standard for wireless networking that replaces the 802.11ac, or Wi-Fi 5, standard. Wi-Fi 6 is the most current standard for all things Wi-Fi.<br>As with any latest Wi-Fi standard, Wi-Fi 6 is potentially better than its predecessors because of modulation and signal processing techniques that promise a more extensive network experience in high-density environments.<br> Wi-Fi 6 uses the same 2.4 gigahertz and 5 GHz bands as 802.11a/g/n/ac. It also has the option to use 6 GHz. This is new and different, and when 6 GHz is in play, it's referred to as Wi-Fi 6E.<br>
    <h1>types of IPv6 include:</h1><br><img src="Images/Wifi.jpeg">  
     <p>Unicast addresses It identifies a unique node on a network and usually refers to a single sender or a single receiver.<br>
    Multicast addresses It represents a group of IP devices and can only be used as the destination of a datagram.<br>
    Anycast addresses It is assigned to a set of interfaces that typically belong to different nodes.<br></p>
